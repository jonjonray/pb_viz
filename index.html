            <strong>What is a Price to Book (P/B) ratio?</strong><br>
            Price to Book is a financial ratio that helps us see the difference between a company's stock price and its book price. This helps people determine whether a company is overvalued or undervalued. For example, Apple has a market value of $732 billion in the below example and it's P/B ratio is 5.53, meaning that it's computed book value is actually around $132 billion. <br>

            <strong>Value vs Growth</strong> <br>
            In the example from above, Apple would be known as a growth stock since it's P/B is very high and the market has high expectations for it. On the other hand, a value stock usually belongs to companies whose P/B is below 1, meaning that the market value is actually less than the book value.<br>
